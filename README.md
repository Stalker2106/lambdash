# Lambda.sh

A simple shell implementation written in Rust. This project aims to explore how shells work and implement basic shell functionality such as command parsing, execution, and built-in commands.

### ⚠️ **WIP (Work In Progress)**

This shell is currently **not stable** and is intended primarily for **educational purposes**. It may not work as expected, and many features are still in development.

### Features (So Far)
- Command parsing
- Tokenization of input
- Variables expanding
- Support for executing external commands
- Basic built-in commands (e.g., `export`, `cd`, etc.)
- Support for input/output redirection (work in progress)
- Pipe functionality (work in progress)
